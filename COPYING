You may use this code if you are making a modification for Marble Blast. Credit is not required, but is appreciated and welcomed. Please credit us as "The Multiplayer Team" when crediting.

Some Marble Blast Gold files were modified to support the protocol. Those files belong to Garage Games and any other company that was involved with the script production of Marble Blast Gold.

HiGuy: Update (2015): The master server system is currently not functioning due to the ephemeral nature of my hosting services. Because of this, you may have issues joining multiplayer games. You should just use direct connect or reimplement the Torque master server (check out JoinServerGui, it has most of the stuff you need). I have a master server script written in PHP that you can use to host a master server for yourself. Check out http://higuy.me/masterserver-nosql.php
